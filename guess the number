# python
# by freecodecamp 
# from the library random "import random" we use random.randint 
# we return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).
# by giving input "int(input(f"Guess a number between 1 and {x}: "))" 
# a user can type in any number in that range and guess the number generated by the computer 
# with the if elif function we give a output to the user, so they know if theyre too low/high
